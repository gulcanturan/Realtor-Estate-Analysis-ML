# USA Real Estate Dataset

In this project, we will be using a USA real estate dataset to predict housing prices using a variety of machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset is available in a CSV file named `realtor-data.csv`. It contains over 400,000 entries and consists of the following columns:

- `status`: Housing status (either "ready for sale" or "ready to build")
- `bed`: Number of bedrooms
- `bath`: Number of bathrooms
- `acre_lot`: Property or land size in acres
- `city`: City name
- `state`: State name
- `zip_code`: Postal code of the area
- `house_size`: House area, size, or living space in square feet
- `prev_sold_date`: Date of the previous sale
- `price`: Housing price, which can be either the current listing price or the recently sold price if the house was sold recently

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook (`*.ipynb` file), you will need the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:


``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `realtor-data.csv` file.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`*.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the code cells to execute the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
5. Modify the code or experiment with different models to further explore the dataset and improve the prediction accuracy.

Feel free to customize and adapt the code according to your needs. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy analyzing and predicting!
